		<p>TEDxMahidolU is a TEDx event organized by the staffs and students of Mahidol University, under the theme "Catching the Future". The event is targeted at audiences in their early- or mid-20s, which would include students who are in their final years of university and for the newly graduated who may be looking to secure their first jobs. This targeted group will include people who are aware of possible future events however have not started what they want to achieve, or those who lacks experience and hence are not ready to achieve their targets. The actual audience would have a larger age range, which will encourage more exchanges of ideas between different members of the communities. The objective of TEDxMahidolU is to encourage these people to take the ideas from the event and adapt it to their own lives, and eventually be able to improve their local communities. </p>
